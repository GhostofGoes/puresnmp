Transport Mappings
==================

:rfc:`3419` defines a large number of transport mappings for sending and
receiving SNMP packet. In the initial implementation, ``puresnmp`` limits
itself to UDP over IPv4 and IPv6. This should cover most use-cases.

Support of additional mappings is possible, but not planned. Pull requests
are always welcome.
